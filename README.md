# making-ds-work
Workshop materials for Making Data Science Work

Companies often struggle to realize value from their data science efforts. Iterative evaluation can help you strategically choose your next DS project, prioritize the work on developing your solution, and, after your solution is in production, help you decide when it is time to retrain or replace it. At every stage of a DS project, you can estimate the value of the solution. In this hands-on workshop, we'll develop and evaluate a predictive model, determining the dollar value of the solution to a fictional company.
